# rock-paper-scissors-game
this game was curated with help from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors , https://pynative.com/python-random-choice/ , 
and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhPZHvhvlsk
it was part of the task for the i4g and zuri fullstack track course
i made use of the random znd random.choice() module, "while loop" and conditionals like 'if' and 'elif'
